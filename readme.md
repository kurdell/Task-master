Title:
	This is Task Master. 

Explanation:
	        My first fullstack web application used to track daily tasks as well as save user notes. I pracitced CRUD functionality within this application along with user validation for login, logout andaccount creation.
		I also leaned about using flask sessions to remeber users login and to keep them logged in when the browser is refreshed. SqlAlchemy was used for the database where I created tables to store user's names and password
		along with utilizing hashing functions for secure storage of personal data. I leanred hwo to use the jinja syntax to generate html pages with flask.

Installation: 
		(1) Python
		(2) Flask
		(3) Werkzeug
		(4) Flask-SQLAlchemy
		(5) SQLAlchemy
